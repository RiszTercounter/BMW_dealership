            <h3>Camera Behind The Car</h3>
            <p class="ringkasan">
              BMW rearview cameras typically employ CCD or CMOS technology to provide enhanced visibility when parking or reversing. These cameras often incorporate dynamic guidelines that project onto the vehicle's display, assisting drivers in accurately gauging distances and maneuvering into tight spaces. Moreover, some BMW models feature advanced 360-degree camera systems that offer a comprehensive view of the vehicle's surroundings, proving invaluable in complex parking situations. Additional features like night vision and high-resolution imaging further enhance the overall driving experience and safety.
